### TODO List :- [Demo](https://upendrabhatt2607.github.io/PHP_Projects/to_do/)

Creating a To-Do List application with PHP involves setting up a database, designing a schema, and establishing a connection. You'll create a task listing page for displaying existing tasks and an input form for adding new ones. Additionally, implementing the four fundamental CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ensures users can manage their tasks effectively. Properly sanitizing and validating user input is crucial for security, and you can enhance the user experience with features like task prioritization, due dates, and styling. Deploying the application and continuously improving it can provide a robust task management solution for users.
